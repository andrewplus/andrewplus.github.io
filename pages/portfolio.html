                <h3>TOSH Companion</h3>
                <p>Using Phonegap and web technologies to connect with the Google Calendar and Wordpress APIs, I made a fully dynamic app for TOSH students that is capable of storing student schedules, displaying daily announcements, showing the current day of the cycle and the academic calendar, and the user's next class&mdash; all automatically updated with the school website and cached on the user's device for offline use. This was made to address the common need for an easy way for students to check the day and refer to their schedules.</p>

                <h3>ACNH Critter Companion</h3>
                <p>One defining feature of the Animal Crossing games is that the game follows real-world time. As night falls or the seasons change in real life, these things change in the game. Just like in real life, the fish and insects change with the seasons and times of day as well. Using a variety of research and online sources for data, I created this automatically-updating website that shows the list of insects and fish currently on the user's island using their device date and time, making it easier users to collect rare critters and fill out their in-game museums.</p>

                <h3>Epic Mickey Config Editor</h3>
                <p>This tool provides a GUI for generating configuration files for the Epic Mickey video game, allowing the user to to adjust enemy properties, change graphics settings, change the boot level, and more. It employs smart text suggestions (auto-fill) for config keys and values as well as user saveable and shareable mixins and presets. Both a web version and desktop version will be released, with the desktop version having the advantage of saving directly to the game directory. The program is currently in a closed beta.</p>

                <h3>HTML5 Wii Menu</h3>
                <p>This little pet project had a simple premise: to try to recreate the Wii system menu in HTML5. It is a little rough around the edges and has not been updated in a few years, but I made it more to test my web skills than to make a finished product. Through making it, I strengthened my skills in JavaScript and CSS skills and overall just had a lot of fun. I may revisit this someday and turn it into a configurable browser homepage down the road.</p>
