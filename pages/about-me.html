                Hello! My name is Andrew Cole. I'm an 18-year old Canadian future Applied Computer Science student at Dalhousie University. I love to create things, tinker, and solve problems using computers. My love for computers began at a young age and has developed through years of curiosity, reading tutorials, frantic Google searching, and working on tons of fun projects. I have a keen interesting in constantly challenging myself by expanding into different libraries, programming languages, and areas of technology. My background is in JavaScript, Python, and PHP&mdash; with a slight bit of Java. Currently, I am exploring Vue.js and brushing up on using Python web frameworks.

                I also have an affinity for video games (though admittedly, these two interests often overlap). When I'm not playing them, I enjoy cracking them open, looking in their insides, and trying to figure out how the developers put them together. Computers aside, I also enjoy watching movies, reading sci-fi novels, and spending time with my two cats, Fluffy and Cleo.
